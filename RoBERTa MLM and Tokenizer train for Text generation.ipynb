For a few weeks I was investigating different models and alternatives in Huggingface to train a text generation model. We have a short list of products with their description and our goal is to obtain the name of the product. I did some experiments with the Transformer model in Tensorflow as well as the T5 summarizer. Finally, in order to deepen the use of Huggingface transformers, I decided to approach the problem with a somewhat more complex approach, an encoder decoder model. Maybe it was not the best option but I wanted to learn new things about huggingface Transformers. In the next post of the series we will introduce you deeper in this concept.\n","\n","Here, in this first part, we will show how to train a tokenizer from scratch and how to use Masked Language Modeling technique to create a RoBERTa model. This personalized model will become the base model for our future encoder Decoder model.\n","\n","# Our Solution\n","For our experiment we are going to train from scratch a RoBERTa model, it will become the encoder and the decoder of a future model. But our domain is very specific, words and concepts about clothes, shapes, colors, … Therefore, we are interested in defining our own tokenizer created from our specific vocabulary, avoiding to include more common words from other domains or use cases which are irrelevant for our final purpose.\n","\n","*We can describe our training phase in three main steps*:\n","- Create and train a byte-level, **Byte-pair encoding tokenizer** with the same special tokens as RoBERTa\n","- Train a RoBERTa model from scratch using **Masked Language Modeling**, MLM.\n","- Warm start and **fine tune an encoder decoder model** based on our RoBERTa pretrained model.\n","\n","In this post we’ll demo how to train a “small” RoBERTa model (6 layers, 768 hidden size, 12 attention heads) – that’s the same number of layers & heads as DistilBERT – on a language from a clothing shop. And in a next notebook, we’ll then fine-tune the model on a downstream task of text generation.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"flij-vszUsQm"},"source":["# Loading the libraries"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"mc6KQfWIUuZB","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1626973396191,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":248,"user":{"displayName":"Eduardo Muñoz Sala","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gi9gTFB7xfdxQyNiKRUzqE5vwb9WQjQuMtQz5F16w=s64","userId":"13317831924226771761"}}},"source":["import os\n","import pandas as pd\n","import tqdm\n","import math"],"execution_count":52,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"tvVMVDYjUaRt"},"source":["# Loading the datasets\n","\n","As we mentioned before, our dataset contains around 31.000 items, about clothes from an important retailer, including a long product description and a short product name, our target variable.
